Hello, I am an Australian developer who lives in Tokyo, Japan.

I work in a giant Japanese corporation doing system architecture for web applications and services.

At my day job the technology is very old and changing anything requires a dozen workflows being approved. So I like to investigate new-ish tech stuff and sometimes also write blog posts about it.

Right now I am interested in GoLang, Cassandra, Docker, Haskell, Scrum and getting stuff done.
