Hello, I am an Australian developer who lives in Tokyo, Japan.

At my day job the technology is very old and changing anything requires a dozen workflows being approved. 
So I like to investigate new-ish tech stuff and sometimes also write blog posts about it.

Right now I am interested in GoLang, Cassandra, Docker, Haskell, Scrum and getting stuff done.

You can often find me complaining on twitter: [@icchanosaur](http://twitter.com/icchanosaur")

## Work History

- After I graduated spent many years as an enterprise Java developer at a bank in Sydney, Australia.

- Then I did a short stint as a terrible English teacher at Junior High School in very rural Japan.

- Then I was a very, very broke freelance PHP developer in Tokyo.

- Then I was a slightly less poor Java web services contractor at a tiny smartphone start-up in Tokyo.

- Then I worked at a small IT consulting company in Tokyo as a C# ASP.NET web application and web services developer who sometimes built Blackberry applications and SharePoint solutions.

- Now I work in a giant Japanese corporation doing system architecture for web applications and services.
